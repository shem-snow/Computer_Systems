This program is a 'simuluator' of a CPU (kind of).

It receives a string which is intended to be an instruction in assembly code that supports only a few arithmetic operations.

It decodes that string to determine which instruction was received and handles invalid instructions by aborting them.

Then it performs the instruction and sets the appropriate flags (CF, ZF, SF, OF).
